# 🎬 Movie Recommendation System

This is a **Content-Based Movie Recommender App** built with **Python + Streamlit**, using the **MovieLens 32M dataset**.  
It recommends movies based on genres and user-applied tags using **TF-IDF vectorization** and **Cosine Similarity**.

---

## 🚀 Features

- 🔍 Recommend movies similar to a given title
- ⭐ Star-based similarity scoring
- 🧠 Uses genres + tags for vector-based similarity
- 💻 Built with Streamlit for interactive UI
- 📂 Uses the MovieLens 32M dataset (2023 release)

## ⚙️ How to Run Locally

1. **Clone the repository**

```bash
git clone https://github.com/srk440/movie-recommendation-system.git
cd movie-recommendation-system
````

2. **Install dependencies**

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

3. **Download the dataset**

Download the following files from the [MovieLens 32M page](https://grouplens.org/datasets/movielens/32m/):

* `movies.csv` (✅ included in this repo)
* `tags.csv` and `ratings.csv` (❌ excluded due to GitHub file size limits)

📁 Place them into this folder:

```
DATA_set/ml-32m/
```

4. **Run the app**

```bash
streamlit run app.py
```

---

## 🧠 How It Works

* Tags and genres are merged into `combined_features`
* TF-IDF converts this text into vectors
* Cosine Similarity finds the top 10 closest matches
* Streamlit displays those with star-based ratings
